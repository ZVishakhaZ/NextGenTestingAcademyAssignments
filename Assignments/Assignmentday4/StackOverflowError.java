public class StackOverflowError {

	/*A StackOverflowError occurs when a program makes
	 *  too many nested method calls (usually from infinite or very deep recursion),
	 *   causing the call stack to run out of memory.
	 *   A StackOverflowError in Java happens when the program’s call
	 *    stack grows beyond the memory limit allocated for it.

✅ Why it happens

The call stack is a special memory area where Java stores:

Method calls

Local variables

Return addresses

When a method calls another method, a new stack frame is added. If this keeps happening without stopping, the stack becomes full.
